# Code Provenance Notes

This project (`mdscope`) is maintained by the repository owner, with substantial AI-assisted code generation/editing (Codex).

Current provenance policy:

- No third-party source code was intentionally copied into this repository.
- The codebase was reviewed for obvious license/header/copyright markers before license selection.
- `mdscope` source code is licensed under the MIT License (see `LICENSE`).

Notes:

- Third-party Python dependencies (e.g., MDAnalysis, SciPy, scikit-learn) remain under their own licenses.
- External tools invoked by `mdscope` (e.g., `fpocket`) remain under their own licenses.
- Test data and scientific input/output files may have separate provenance or reuse restrictions and should be tracked independently from the code license.
